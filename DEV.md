Riscbox development
===================

This file contains only current and future work. Completed implementation
history belongs in `CHANGELOG.md`; durable project constraints and current
architecture belong in `AGENTS.md`; user-visible behavior belongs in
`README.md`.

Development priorities
----------------------

1.  Keep current xv6 and deliberately prepared current Alpine images booting
    without emulator-specific guest patches. Let focused guest failures select
    compatibility work.
2.  Fill small, broadly useful RVA23 gaps when architectural probes and real
    guests can validate them. Vectors, hypervisor support, and multiple harts
    remain out of scope.
3.  Tighten QEMU `virt` device-tree and platform compatibility where firmware
    or Linux depends on it. Correct the existing platform instead of adding
    compatibility modes.
4.  Improve image preparation only when a small loader or boot feature removes
    material deployment friction. Prepared raw kernels and initrds remain the
    baseline.
5.  Benchmark before optimizing the interpreter, WASM boundary, storage, or 9p
    implementation. Correctness remains the first gate.

There is no active implementation milestone at present. Promote one bounded
item below into an active design only when guest evidence, deployment needs, or
measurements establish its acceptance boundary.

Candidate work
--------------

### Framebuffer demonstration

Add guest framebuffer and input demonstration programs, configure those devices
in an image, and connect dirty-region callbacks to a canvas in the Risclet page.
Validate the complete guest-to-page path together. The current Risclet demo is
intentionally terminal-only.

### Boot and image loading

Evaluate a standard bootloader path, compressed kernel loading, and other image
features only against a concrete Alpine deployment problem. Linux already
handles compressed initrds after Riscbox loads them opaquely. Any new loader
must justify its code size and failure surface relative to image preparation.

### Performance

Measure WASM throughput, module size, allocation, and memory use before choosing
work. Candidate measurements include interpreter hot paths, HTTP block request
latency, 9p request/reply copy volume, concurrent request latency, resident and
logical 9p tree sizes, and peak lazy-load memory.

Design and milestone format
---------------------------

Add an active design here before implementing work that spans subsystems. Keep
it short and current, using these sections as needed:

*   Problem and evidence: the guest failure, deployment need, or measurement.
*   Scope and exclusions: the bounded behavior and explicit non-goals.
*   Data and ownership: types, state, lifetimes, storage, and concurrency.
*   Flow and interfaces: files, function signatures, ABI or configuration
    changes, and error handling.
*   Milestones and acceptance: ordered increments with focused tests, WASM
    checks, guest validation, and measurements.

Remove completed milestones rather than accumulating checked-off plans. Move
lasting decisions and results into the appropriate current or historical
document during the same commit.

Deferred findings
-----------------

Record an out-of-scope issue here when development uncovers it. Include the
observed behavior, affected guest or interface, evidence or reproduction, why
it is deferred, and the condition that should trigger reconsideration. Remove
the entry when it becomes an active design or is resolved.

No deferred findings are currently recorded.
